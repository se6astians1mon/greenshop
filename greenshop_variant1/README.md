# Greenshop

This project provides a platform to conduct a psychological experience on buying habits. It consists of a two "pages" introducting the user to the experience, a fake webshop where one can do grocery shopping and a survey to get data about the users habits. At the end, the user can play a game of dice and win (if the dice hits 6) the basket he/she just created.

The project currently uses a firebase-react-material-ui stack.

To use this project, you need node.js installed on your machine. Then clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies (material ui, react router etc.) in the project folder. You can run a development version by typing `npm start`.

To bundle a version you can then place on any server, run `npm run build`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
